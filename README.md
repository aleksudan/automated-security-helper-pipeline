# Automated Security Helper Pipeline Template

The Automated Security Helper ([ASH](https://github.com/aws-samples/automated-security-helper)) pipeline CDK template, can be used to provision an end to end pipeline using CodePipeline, CodeCommit and CodeBuild.  
The solution will scan new commits using [ASH](https://github.com/aws-samples/automated-security-helper), will save the report into S3 bucket, and will alert to SecurityHub if the scan failed.
